# Homework 2: Visualizing Interesting Datasets

## **Dataset 1:** Analysing the number of Females and Males in the U.S. House of Representatives

The original source of this data can be found [here](https://data.nasa.gov/resource/2vr3-k9wn.json)

This file represents the total number of current U.S. Representatives. Males far outnumber females in the data. The data therefore shows a critical need for greater gender equality and representation in one of the most powerful political bodies of the United States.

## **Dataset 2:** Analysing the number of meteors and from which orbit classes they came from

The original source of this data can be found [here](https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true&role_type=representative&limit=438)

This file represents the number of meteors and comets that hit the United States from 2010-2015. The data displays a noticeable downward trend in the years 2011-2013. Further research into this field could prove interesting to help explain this trend.
